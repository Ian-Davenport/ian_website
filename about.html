            <p>
                Yes, you may have already guessed that the really cute kid in this picture is me! I think I'm about two or three years old here and can still remember the photograph being taken, as remember holding the baby monkey even today.
            </p>
                <br>
            <p>
                Since this was taken I've spent a few days in hospital when I was around eight years old, started and finished both primary & secondary schools and started work.
            </p>
                <br>
            <p>
                I left school at sixteen and went to work in a Manchester city centre advertising agency, as I'd previously seen a programme about the business and thought it looked exciting. As a by now almost eighteen year old at a small family company, it was neither exciting nor had a future so I bid that goodbye 
            </p>
                <br>
            <p>
                Next I spent almost ten years at a stationery company doing everything from taking and processing orders to serving customers, packaging orders for courier despatch and taking inward deliveries amongst many others. That was a really great time, though I sought the world of big companies after all that time at a family firm.
            </p>
                <br>
            <p>
                A number of roles followed until I began to get into technology. At one place I worked, I'd seen Mike the onsite IT guy fix a colleague's computer base unit issue there and then and that really sparked an interest to know more about what he was doing. 
            </p>

        <div class="restOfAbout">

            <P>
                The role I was doing was to me boring, but one I'd fallen into after being made redundant from my telephone role on the mortgages retention team at the same company. Therefore due to seeing Mike do his stuff, I started to look at courses I could do, finally finding one and enrolled. It was here I learnt how to completely strip down and rebuild a computer, plus also learnt about networking computers together using RJ-45s in the classroom.
            </P>
            <br>
            <p>
                From this in April 2000, I immediately got a role at Barclay's Bank working on an IT Support team supporting the business management who worked from home and went out visiting high value business customers.
            </p>
                <br>
            <p>
                After six years at Barclays I then moved onto Cable & Wireless, though this became Vodafone after they bought C&W in 2012. Starting C&W late 2006 I was assigned to the Public & Government team supporting local and central government departments, the NHS, UK Fire & Rescue services and I was the lead for UK Polices. Supporting the fixed fibre networks, specifically the Government and Police secure networks (GSI & CJX), though these were superseded by the PSN around 2016. I then moved over to the secure orders team in April 2016, where I took over order processing for Vodafone customer Airwave who provided digital radio communications to the UK blue light emergency services.
            </p>
                <br>
            <p>
                Overall there were approximately 350 staff from all parts of the British Isles who came under the umbrella of the internal organisation we were part of, however Vodafone had decided they wanted all the functions together under one roof, meaning all our roles moved down to Newbury in Berkshire from mid 2019.
            </p>
                <br>
            <p>
                Up to this point the last coding I'd done was at secondary school, however having always had a keen interest in technical things, plus hearing all the things which indicated there was a shortage of staff in this field, I firstly began to learn on Codecademy & freeCodeCamp as I wanted to use the opportunity to retrain and look into either Web or Software development as a new career direction.
            </p>
                <br>
            <p>
                Therefore I found myself enrolled at a coding bootcamp in Manchester as a self funded student, to retrain and learn some of these in demand new skills.
