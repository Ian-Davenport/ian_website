    <h1>Stockport History</h1>
    <br><br>
    <p>
        Stockport is a large town in Greater Manchester, England, 7 miles (11 km) south-east of Manchester city centre, where the River Goyt and Tame merge to create the <strong>River Mersey</strong>. It is the largest town in the metropolitan borough of the same name.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The historical centre of Stockport is the Market Place. It is situated on a 240 million year old red sandstone cliff overlooking what was once an important ford over the River Mersey. This ford was the meeting point of several Roman roads.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Most of the town is within the boundaries of the historic county of Cheshire, with the area north of the Mersey in the historic county of Lancashire. Stockport in the 16th century was a small town entirely on the south bank of the Mersey, known for the cultivation of hemp and manufacture of rope. In the 18th century, it had one of the first mechanised silk factories in the British Isles. Stockport's predominant industries of the 19th century were the cotton and allied industries. It was also at the centre of the country's hatting industry, which by 1884 was exporting more than six million hats a year; the last hat works in Stockport closed in 1997.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Dominating the western approaches to the town is Stockport Viaduct. Built in 1840, its 27 brick arches carry the mainline railways from Manchester to Birmingham and London over the River Mersey.
    </p>   
    <br>
    <h3>Early history</h3>
    <p>
        The earliest evidence of human occupation in the wider area are microliths from the hunter-gatherers of the Mesolithic period (the Middle Stone Age, about 8000–3500 BC) and weapons and stone tools from the Neolithic period (the New Stone Age, 3500–2000 BC). Early Bronze Age (2000–1200 BC) remains include stone hammers, flint knives, palstaves (bronze axe heads), and funerary urns; all finds were chance discoveries, not the results of systematic searches of a known site. There is a gap in the age of finds between about 1200 BC and the start of the Roman period in about 70 AD, which may indicate depopulation, possibly due to a poorer climate.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Despite a strong local tradition, there is little evidence of a Roman military station at Stockport. It is assumed that roads from Cheadle to Ardotalia (Melandra) and Manchester to Buxton crossed close to the town centre. The preferred site is at a ford over the Mersey, known to be paved in the 18th century, but it has never been proved that this or any roads in the area are Roman. Hegginbotham reported (in 1892) the discovery of Roman mosaics at Castle Hill (around Stockport market) in the late 18th century, during the construction of a mill, but noted it was "founded on tradition only"; substantial stonework has never been dated by modern methods. However, Roman coins and pottery were probably found there during the 18th century. A cache of coins dating from 375–378 AD may have come from the banks of the Mersey at Daw Bank; these were possibly buried for safekeeping at the side of a road.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Industrialisation</h3>
    <p>
        Hatmaking was established in north Cheshire and south-east Lancashire by the 16th century. From the 17th century Stockport became a centre for the hatting industry and later the silk industry. Stockport expanded rapidly during the Industrial Revolution, helped particularly by the growth of the cotton manufacturing industries. However, economic growth took its toll, and 19th century philosopher Friedrich Engels wrote in 1844 that Stockport was "renowned as one of the duskiest, smokiest holes" in the whole of the industrial area.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Stockport was one of the prototype textile towns.[28] In the early 18th century, England was not capable of producing silk of sufficient quality to be used as the warp in woven fabrics. Suitable thread had to be imported from Italy, where it was spun on water-powered machinery. In about 1717 John Lombe travelled to Italy and copied the design of the machinery. On his return he obtained a patent on the design, and went into production in Derby. When Lombe tried to renew his patent in 1732, silk spinners from towns including Manchester, Macclesfield, Leek, and Stockport successfully petitioned parliament to not renew the patent. Lombe was paid off, and in 1732 Stockport's first silk mill (the first water-powered textile mill in the north-west of England) was opened on a bend in the Mersey. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Silk weaving expanded until in 1769 two thousand people were employed in the industry. By 1772 the boom had turned to bust, possibly due to cheaper foreign imports; by the late 1770s trade had recovered. The cycle of boom and bust would continue throughout the textile era.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The combination of a good water power site (described by Rodgers as "by far the finest of any site within the lowland" [of the Manchester region]) and a workforce used to textile factory work meant Stockport was well placed to take advantage of the phenomenal expansion in cotton processing in the late 18th century. Warren's mill in the market place was the first. Power came from an undershot water wheel in a deep pit, fed by a tunnel from the River Goyt. The positioning on high ground, unusual for a water-powered mill, contributed to an early demise, but the concept of moving water around in tunnels proved successful, and several tunnels were driven under the town from the Goyt to power mills. In 1796, James Harrisson drove a wide cut from the Tame which fed several mills in the Park, Portwood. Other water-powered mills were built on the Mersey.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The town was connected to the national canal network by the 5 miles (8.0 km) of the Stockport branch of the Ashton Canal opened in 1797 which continued in use until the 1930s. Much of it is now filled in, but there is an active campaign to re-open it for leisure uses.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        In the early 19th century, the number of hatters in the area began to increase, and a reputation for quality work was created. The London firm of Miller Christy bought out a local firm in 1826, a move described by Arrowsmith as a "watershed". By the latter part of the century hatting had changed from a manual to a mechanised process, and was one of Stockport's primary employers; the area, with nearby Denton, was the leading national centre. Support industries, such as blockmaking, trimmings, and leatherware, became established. Stockport Armoury was completed in 1862.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The First World War cut off overseas markets, which established local industries and eroded Stockport's eminence. Even so, in 1932 more than 3000 people worked in the hatting industry, making it the third biggest employer after textiles and engineering. The depression of the 1930s and changes in fashion greatly reduced the demand for hats, and the demand that existed was met by cheaper wool products made elsewhere, for example the Luton area.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        In 1966, the largest of the region's remaining felt hat manufacturers, Battersby & Co, T & W Lees, J. Moores & Sons, and Joseph Wilson & Sons, merged with Christy & Co to form Associated British Hat Manufacturers, leaving Christy's and Wilson's (at Denton) as the last two factories in production. The Wilson's factory closed in 1980, followed by the Christy's factory in 1997, bringing to an end over 400 years of hatting in the area. The industry is commemorated by the UK's only dedicated hatting museum, Hat Works.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Recent history</h3>
    <p>
        Since the start of the 20th century Stockport has moved away from being a town dependent on cotton and its allied industries to one with a varied base. It makes the most of its varied heritage attractions, including a national museum of hatting, a unique system of Second World War air raid tunnel shelters in the town centre, and a late medieval merchants' house on the 700-year-old Market Place. In 1967, the Stockport air disaster occurred, when a British Midland Airways C-4 Argonaut aeroplane crashed in the Hopes Carr area of the town, resulting in 72 deaths among the passengers and crew.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Stockport was a township mostly within the Macclesfield Hundred within the historic county of Cheshire with a small part on the north side of the Mersey in Lancashire. The Municipal Corporations Act 1835 made Stockport a municipal borough divided into six wards with a council consisting of 14 aldermen and 42 councillors. Under the terms of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, Stockport Poor Law Union was established on 3 February 1837 and was responsible for an area covering 16 parishes with a total population of 68,906. Stockport Union built a workhouse at Shaw Heath in 1841. In 1888, its status was raised to County Borough, becoming the County Borough of Stockport. 
        <br><br>
        In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, Stockport amalgamated with neighbouring districts to form the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport in the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1986, Greater Manchester County Council was abolished and Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council assumed many of its functions, effectively becoming a unitary authority. In 2011, Stockport bid for city status as part of the 2012 Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations but was unsuccessful.

    <h2>Historic buildings of Stockport</h2>
    <br>
    <h4>Underbank Hall</h4>
    <p>
        Underbank Hall is a 16th-century town house in the centre of Stockport, Greater Manchester, England. The hall dates back to the 15th century and is a Grade II* listed building. It was home of the Arden family of Bredbury until 1823 when it was sold by William Arden, 2nd Baron Alvanley to pay off debts, and became a bank. A banking hall was then added to the rear in 1919. The hall is still used as a bank today and currently houses the NatWest branch for Stockport.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>St. Mary's Church</h4>
    <p>
        St Mary's Church is the oldest parish church in the town of Stockport. A church was on the site by 1190. A sandstone church was built during the incumbency of Richard de Vernon, 1306-1320 and only its chancel remains. The rest of the present church was built between 1813 and 1817 to the design of Lewis Wyatt. There was a further restoration in 1848 to replace weathered masonry. Further restoration was carried out in 1882. The tower originated in the 14th century and was rebuilt in 1612–16 and again in 1810.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The chancel is built in local red sandstone in the decorated style. The rest of the church is Runcorn sandstone in the perpendicular style. Its plan consists of a west tower, a wide nave with galleries, a south porch, and a chancel with a vestry to its north.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Stockport Market Hall</h4>
    <p>
        Stockport's covered market hall was originally open on all sides, which gave rise to its local nickname of the "glass umbrella". One of the market's most famous stall holders was 
        Ephraim Marks (the 'Marks' in Marks & Spencer!) and it was he whom was the first to enclose his stall to protect his customers from the cold. The rest of the market was enclosed within two years of his innovation as still can be seen today.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Stockport Town Hall</h4>
    <p>
        Stockport Town Hall houses the government and administrative functions of Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council. Stockport Town Hall is a Grade II listed building. The building, which was designed by the architect Sir Alfred Brumwell Thomas in the English Baroque style, was opened by the then Prince and Princess of Wales on 7 July 1908. To commemorate the Royal visit, part of Heaton Lane, a main shopping street in the town, was renamed Prince's Street.
        <br>
        The ballroom in the town hall served as a hospital during the First World War and to was used as a home for refugees from the Channel Islands during the Second World War.  Sir Alfred Brumwell Thomas also designed Belfast City Hall which has a similar look to Stockport's Town Hall.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>The Queen's Head</h4>
    <p>
        A late 18th or early 19th century public house, though originally a shop with a public house added in the later 19th century. This pub is extremely narrow and shows how many small urban pubs must have looked a hundred years ago. The interior was remodelled about 1930 and consists of three rooms and appears little altered. The extreme narrowness of the interior led to some rearrangement of some of the internal woodwork in the early 1990s but this was carried out with care by Samuel Smiths and the pub still retains an authentic historic ambience. On the top of the bar counter are two sets of spirit cocks which used to dispense drink from the rooms above. The original Queen's Head seems to have occupied a larger building abutting on the east but was demolished when St Petersgate Bridge was built in 1866-8 and moved into the present premises.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Three Shires Hall</h4>
    <p>
        The Three Shires Hall, originally a town house and later used for other purposes, it is timber framed, and has two storeys and two bays. Both bays are gabled, the gables have bargeboards and finials, and the upper floor and gables are jettied. There are two shop fronts, one modern and the other older, and the windows are 19th-century casements. The gables are decorated with quatrefoils, and in the upper floor are curved braces and herringbone decoration.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>The White Lion</h4>
    <p>
        The White Lion today is sadly no longer a public house. The White Lion has a fascinating history since it was first granted a licence in the 14th century. It was originally a popular coaching inn on the main route in and out of Stockport and close to the only crossing point of the Mersey at Lancashire Bridge.

        The pub was rebuilt several times over the centuries and was re-fronted in a mock Tudor black and white style, in 1823. The last major remodelling took place in 1904-1906, giving the building the distinctive features it still carries today.
        
        To preserve the building’s rich history, it has been sympathetically restored. The grand staircase, original glass and unique turret room have all been preserved and finished in a modern design. The original pub sign has also been incorporated into the new development, giving a nod to the past and its former life.
        
        The renovation of the White Lion forms part of the council’s £7 million investment in the Underbanks and Market Place to transform this unique and important part of Stockport Town Centre.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Strawberry Studios</h4>
    <p>
        The facility was originally called 'Inter-City Studios' and located above the 'Nield and Hardy' record store in Stockport’s town centre. Having helped out there for a few months, Peter Tattersall decided to buy the studio and its equipment, which consisted of two tape machines and a few microphones. Tattersall invited Eric Stewart, then lead guitarist and singer of the Mindbenders and later a member of 10cc, to join him as a partner in July 1968. The pair moved to larger premises at No. 3 Waterloo Road in October 1968, with Stewart choosing the studio's new name in honour of his favourite Beatles song, "Strawberry Fields Forever".
        <br><br>
        Within months songwriter and future 10cc member Graham Gouldman joined the pair as an investor and the studio was used extensively by Stewart, Gouldman and the other two musicians who would join them to form 10cc, Lol Creme and Kevin Godley.  In 1976 Stewart described the studio's early days: "It was a very tiny studio with some stereo equipment and the walls lined with egg boxes to provide sound insulation. There was a makeshift sort of control desk tied together with sellotape and string, but it was good enough for what I wanted to do, and it was the only studio near Manchester.
        <br><br>
        The partners in the business continued to upgrade equipment at the studios and a deal was struck in December 1969 with US producers to book the studios solidly for three months to record bubblegum songs, using the talents of Gouldman, Stewart, Godley and Creme. Stewart said: "That allowed us to get the extra equipment to turn it into a real studio. To begin with they were interested in Graham's songwriting and when they heard that he was involved in a studio I think they thought the most economical thing for them to do would be to book his studio and then put him to work there – but they ended up recording Graham's songs and then some of Kevin and Lol's songs, and we were all working together."
        <br><br>
        Between 1972 and 1976 was one of great success for 10cc and one that, consequently, established Strawberry as a major recording studio. All four 10cc albums (and eight top-ten singles, including two number one records) were recorded in Stockport.  As well as being home for 10cc, Strawberry was still available for outside bookings and the Studio was used by such artists as Paul McCartney, the Bay City Rollers, Granada Television, Joy Division, The Stone Roses, The Buzzcocks, New Order, James, The Smiths, Simply Red and St Winifred’s School Choir.

    <br>
    <h4>The Stockport Air Disaster</h4>
    <P>
        On June 4th 1967, a DC4 Argonaut of British Midland Aviation G-ALHG, on charter to Arrowsmith Tours of Liverpool left Palma, Mallorca at 5am for it's return trip to Manchester Airport carrying a load of returning holiday makers back home. The excitement mounted as the plane banked over Denton and they could see Stockport in front of them and knew they were only minutes away from Ringway Airport. But in the cockpit, Captain Harry Marlow was worried. He was having trouble maintaining his height and he knew he would never reach Ringway.  Just one tiny wedge of wasteland nestles among the complex densely packed buildings in the centre of Stockport. And it was there that the giant Argonaut airliner dropped to the ground. Aboard the plane 72 people died; but no one on the ground was hurt.
